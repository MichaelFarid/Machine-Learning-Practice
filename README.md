# Machine-Learning-Practice
This repository contains multiple machine learning algorithms written in Python for regression/classification. I will add new scripts as I learn more ML theory and implement it in Python code 

Legend:
GradDec- gradient decent

Lin- linear

Log- logistic

MultiVar- multivariable

Quad- quadratic
